# Custom Cuisine Website

Static marketing page for a fictional AI-powered meal plan service. Built with semantic HTML and modern CSSâ€”no build tools or other dependencies.

## Prerequisites
- Git to clone the repository (or download the ZIP from GitHub)
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) for the built-in development server

## Run locally
1. **Get the code**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/CustomCuisine-Website-Project.git
   cd CustomCuisine-Website-Project
   ```
   Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with the repository owner's GitHub username. If you downloaded a ZIP instead, extract it and open the folder in your terminal.
2. **Start a web server**
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
   This serves the site at `http://localhost:8000`.
3. **View the site**
   Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.
4. **Stop the server**
   Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal when you're done.

### Alternative
If you're using Visual Studio Code, install the **Live Server** extension and click **Go Live** to preview the site without using the command line.

You can also double-click `index.html` to open it directly, but serving it through a web server better reflects how it will behave when deployed.
